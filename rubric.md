# A4 Data Wrangling
This rubric is intended to help guide expectations and increase transparency. However, it **is not** necessarily fully exhaustive. Make sure to read the detailed explanation on Canvas, and follow the best practices described in the course book and in class.

For this assignment, you must use the appropriate `dplyr` functions to complete each task, returning the specified data type. Partial credit will be given where appropriate. 

## Loading and Exploring Data (**28 points**)
- Load the `dplyr` package (**1 point**)
- Download appropriate data into a `data/` directory (**2 points**)
    - -1 if not in the `data/` directory
- Load your data, making sure to not interpret strings as factors (**2 points**)
    - -1 if strings aren't properly treated

- Get summary information about the dataset (**3 points**)
    - 1 point for column names
    - 1 point for rows
    - 1 point for columns

- Write the `get_col_info()` function (**10 points**)
    - 1 point for extracting the values from the dataframe using `dplyr`
    - 1 point for an appropriate check for the variable type
    - 2 points for returning proper information for double variables
    - 1 point for dealing with NA values appropriately for double variables
    - 2 points for returning proper values for non-double columns with < 10 unique values
    - 3 points for returning proper values for non-double columns with > 10 unique values (including a method to *randomly sample* the values)

- Demonstrate that your function works by passing a column name of your choice and the kickstarter data to your function (**2 points**) 
    - 1 point for function working
    - 1 point for storing in a variable with a meaningful name

- Write the `get_summary_info()` function (**3 points**)
    - 1 point for using the `get_col_info()` function
    - 2 points for returning a *list* where the keys are the column names and the values are the output from `get_col_info()`
    
- Demonstrate that your `get_summary_info()` function works (**2 points**) 
    - 1 point for function working
    - 1 point for storing in a variable with a meaningful name

- Take note of 3 observations that you find interesting from this summary (**3 points**)
    - 1 point for each observation, must be driven by the results of the `get_summary_info()` function

## Asking question of the data ------------------- (**29 points**)
For each of the following questions, you will earn credit for each of the following:
(note, this in not necessarily an exhaustive list of possible deductions):
    
- Applying the appropriate logic to answer the question
- Returning (only) the appropriate information that answers the question. For example, if you were asked for the names of the projects with the lowest goals, you would only return a _vector_ of the names of those projects (**not** a data frame containing them). In some cases, the result will be only a single value.
- Storing the result of the question in a variable with a meaningful name. For example, if you were asked for the project(s) with the lowest goal, you could create a variable called `lowest_goal_projects`.

- What was the name of the project(s) with the highest goal? (**3 points**)

- What was the category of the project(s) with the lowest goal? (**3 points**)

- How many projects had a deadline in 2018? (**4 points**)
    
- What proportion or projects weren't successful? Your result can be a decimal (**4 points**)

- What was the amount pledged for the project with the most backers? (**3 points**)

- Of all of the projects that *failed*, what was the name of the project with the highest amount of money pledged? (**3 points**)

- How much total money was pledged to projects that weren't successful? (**3 points**)

- Write (and answer) two meaningful questions of the data that can be answered using similar operations (`filter`, `pull`, `summarize`, `mutate`, etc.). (**6 points**, 3 points each)
    
## Performing analysis by *grouped* observations ----------------- (38 Points)
For each of the following questions, you will earn credit for each of the following:
(note, this in not necessarily an exhaustive list of possible deductions):
    
- Appropriately grouping your data
- Accurately computing summary information
- Honing in on desired rows
- Returning (only) the value of interest (category)
- Storing the result of the question in a variable with a meaningful name

- Which category had the most money pledged (total)? (**5 points**)

- Which country had the most backers?  (**5 points**)

- Which year had the most money pledged (**5 points**)

- What were the top 3 main categories in 2018 (as ranked by number of backers)? (**5 points**)

- What was the most common day of the week on which to launch a project? (**5 points**)

- What was the least successful day on which to launch a project? (**5 points**)

- Write (and answer) two meaningful questions of the data that can be answered by _grouping_ the data and performing summary calculations. (**8 points**, 4 points each)
    - 1 point for a meaningful question
    - 1 point for grouping
    - 1 point for computing summary information
    - 1 point for answering question correctly

## Code clarity (**5 points**)
To earn full points, you must not have any `lintr()` errors. 
- -1 point for 1 - 2 `lintr` errors
- -2 points for 3 - 4 `lintr` errors
- -3 points for 5 - 6 `lintr` errors
- -4 points for 7 - 8 `lintr` errors
- -5 points for 9+ `lintr` errors
